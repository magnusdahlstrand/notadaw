# Not a DAW

## TODO
- Record one track
- Record multiple tracks simultaneously
- Stream upload tracks as they are recording
- Generate basic waveforms
- Playback, jumping in time
- Add markers, jump to them
- Share URL so others can listen
- Scrolling, zooming

## Later
- Allow segments to be labelled and put into a pool of clips for later use
- Highlight time spans and remove them, bridging clips before and after
